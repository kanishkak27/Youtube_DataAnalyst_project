#  YouTube Data Analysis Using Python

##  Project Overview
This project, **YouTube Data Analysis**, is an end-to-end data analytics project built using **Python**.  
It focuses on exploring and analyzing YouTube video data to uncover trends, engagement patterns, and insights that explain why certain videos perform better than others.  

By leveraging libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly**, I performed deep **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and created powerful visualizations to present the findings clearly and interactively.

---

##  Objectives
- Understand what drives video performance on YouTube.
- Identify correlations between **views, likes, comments, and categories**.
- Visualize engagement metrics using clear and interactive plots.
- Derive actionable insights that can guide content strategy for creators or brands.

##  Key Features
 Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas**  
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for statistical insights  
 Interactive charts using **Plotly**  
 Visual trend exploration with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
 Correlation heatmaps, category-wise analysis, and top-performing video metrics  
 Insights summary for better data storytelling

##  Tech Stack & Libraries Used
| Library | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Python** | Core programming language |
| **Pandas** | Data cleaning and manipulation |
| **Matplotlib** | Static visualizations |
| **Seaborn** | Statistical and correlation plots |
| **Plotly** | Interactive and dynamic visualizations |
| **NumPy** | Numerical operations |

---

##  What I Learned
- Conducting complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** from raw data to insights  
- Cleaning inconsistent or missing data effectively  
- Designing compelling **data visualizations** that communicate findings clearly  
- Understanding audience behavior and engagement patterns on YouTube  
- Combining multiple visualization tools for different types of insights  
- Structuring a data analytics project professionally for GitHub presentation

##  Project Description
This project analyzes a dataset containing YouTube video statistics such as:
- **Title**
- **Views**
- **Likes**
- **Comments**
- **Category**
- **Published Date**

The analysis identifies:
- Which categories or genres attract the most views  
- Relationship between **likes, comments, and views**  
- Which upload patterns or engagement metrics correlate with video success  
- Outlier detection (extremely high-performing or low-performing videos)  

All insights are supported with clear and appealing visualizations to make data interpretation easy and actionable.

---

##  Challenges Faced
- Handling **missing and inconsistent data** within the dataset  
- Managing **large dataframes** efficiently during analysis  
- Creating clean, minimal, and non-overlapping visualizations  
- Balancing between **static and interactive** plotting libraries  
- Time management during data exploration and refinement  

Each of these challenges improved my problem-solving and debugging skills significantly.

---

##  Time Spent
Approximately **8-9 week days** were dedicated to:
- Data exploration and cleaning  
- Visualization design  
- Documentation and presentation setup  
- Refining results for clarity and professionalism  

---

##  Insights Gained
- **Videos with high likes-to-views ratio** often come from specific content categories.  
- **Engagement through comments** is a strong indicator of audience connection.  
- Publishing frequency and topic relevance play a key role in overall channel performance.  
- Data storytelling through visuals can be more powerful than raw numbers.  

---

##  Future Enhancements
- Add **sentiment analysis** on video comments to assess viewer emotions.  
- Integrate a **dashboard (Streamlit/Power BI)** for real-time visualization.  
- Automate YouTube data fetching via **YouTube Data API v3** for live analytics.

##  Conclusion
This project was a complete hands-on experience that combined data wrangling, analysis, and visualization ‚Äî helping me understand both the **technical** and **storytelling** sides of data analytics.  
It strengthened my Python data stack knowledge and improved my approach toward **real-world problem-solving with data**.
