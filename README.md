# Youtube_DataAnalyst_project
This repository contains my work for the “Data Analytics Real-World Projects in Python”, where I used major data-analysis libraries .
Through these projects I deepen my understanding of the full data-analytics pipeline: from data ingestion and cleaning, through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to deriving business-insights and communicating results.

Key Learnings:

How to work with different kinds of data: Excel spreadsheets, geospatial data, time-series data, text data. 


How to perform data cleaning, merging/concatenating, grouping/aggregating, and filtering in Python. 


How to create expressive visualisations: pie charts, bubble charts, wordclouds, maps, etc. 


Insight into how analysts transform messy real-world data into actionable conclusions.
